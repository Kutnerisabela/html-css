            <h3>Evermore - Taylor Swift</h3>
            <p>
                And I was catching my breath <br>
                Staring out an open window <br>
                Catching my death <br>
                And I couldn't be sure <br>
                I had a feeling so peculiar <br>
                That this pain would be for <br>
                Evermore
            </p>

            <p>
                And the skeletons in both our closets <br>
                Plotted hard to fuck this up <br>
                And the old men that I've swindled <br>
                Really did believe I was the one <br>
                And the ladies lunching have their stories about <br>
                When you passed through town <br>
                But with that, it was all before I locked it down <br>

            <h3>Tolerate it - Taylor Swift</h3>
                <p>
                    While you were out building other worlds, where was I? <br>
                    Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire? <br>
                    I made you my temple, my mural, my sky <br>
                    Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life <br>
                    Drawing hearts in the byline <br>
                    Always taking up too much space or time <br>
                    You assume I'm fine <br>
                    But what would you do if I <br>
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                    Break free and leave us in ruins <br>
                    Took this dagger in me and removed it <br>
                    Gain the weight of you then lose it <br>
                    Believe me, I could do it <br>
                    If it's all in my head tell me now <br>
                    Tell me I've got it wrong somehow <br>
                </p>

            <h3 class="h3e">Marjorie - Taylor Swift</h3>
            <p>
                I should've asked you how to be <br>
                Asked you to write it down for me <br>
                Should've kept every grocery store receipt <br>
                'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me <br>
                Watched as you signed your name Marjorie <br>
                All your closets of backlogged dreams <br>
                And how you left them all to me <br>
            </p>

            <h3>long story short - Taylor Swift</h3>
                <p>
                    Fatefully <br>
                    I tried to pick my battles <br>
                    'Til the battle picked me <br>
                    Misery <br>
                    Like the war of words, I shouted in my sleep <br>
                    And you passed right by <br>
                    I was in the alley surrounded on all sides <br>
                    The knife cuts both ways <br>
                    If the shoe fits, walk in it <br>
                    'Til your high heels break <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    And I fell from the pedestal <br>
                    Right down the rabbit hole <br>
                    Long story short, it was a bad time <br>
                </p>
